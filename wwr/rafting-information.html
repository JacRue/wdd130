                    <h3>Camping</h3>
                    <p> The site is along the banks of the Wild Ride River, just off a paved road, and best of all,
                        overnight dry camping (there are no hookups available) is free!.
                        Pitch a tent or camp under the stars on your next getaway to Rivers are Awesome Park. What
                        better way to get in touch with the natural beauty of the park than to camp out surrounded by
                        exceptional wildlife, inspiring mountain ranges and sprawling meadows.
                    </p>
                    <p>No electricity is available or public restrooms (just as mother nature intended) and the only
                        running water is the river you'll be camping next to. Firepits are in place for public use at
                        each campsite and river posts to tie-down your rafts.
                        We do ask what ever you bring in, you bring out, let’s do our part to care for the earth and
                        respect others who will camp after you.</p>
                    <p>Have a safe and enjoyable ride on the rivers at Rivers are Awesome Park.</p>

                    <p>The rapids are a fun adventure to experience; however, we suggest you take care and prepare
                        properly for any situation you may encounter before you embark on your epic ride. </p>
                    <img class="box-img-3-b" src="images/rapids_2_pg2.jpg" alt="Rapids">
                    <p> We suggest bringing safety equipment like, safety vests, helmets, first-aid kits, prepackaged
                        food/water, and always let someone know where you’ll be rafting or camping who isn’t going on
                        your epic adventure. These are just a few of our suggestions to get you started. </p>
