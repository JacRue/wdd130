 <h2>Jacob Ruesch</h2>
 <p>Hello everybody. I'd like to introduce myself. I am a single father 
     to three beautiful girls. I was born and raised in Layton Utah but
     I currently live in Houston Texas, I have been here for over five 
     years now and I truly miss seeing the mountains everyday (Texas is 
     so flat but big sky).
 </p>
 <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,
     since I was a little boy, my favorite song to this day is "I am a Child
      of God", my children love to hear me sing it to them as a lullaby 
      before bed.
 </p>
 <p>I am the Sous Chef at Eculent, we are a tasting menu resturant. We serve
     26 courses over a three hour dinner service, we will be changing to our
    new menu in May of 2022, it will be a 40 course dinner service and we are
    very excited about it.
 </p>
 <p>I currently have an Associate of Applied Scince in Culinary Arts degree,
     but I am now working towards a BS in Applied Technologies (Web Development).
 </p>
 <p>I enjoy spending all my free time with my children, so I don't currently have
     very many hobbies. I look forward to meeting and working with all my classmates
     and growing on this new path we are on, thank you for your time and intrust in 
     getting to know me.
